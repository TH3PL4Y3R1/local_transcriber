⚡ Local AI Transcriber & Summarizer Project — Summary
✅ Core idea
Develop a fully local Python-based tool that can:
1️⃣ Transcribe audio recordings (e.g., lectures, classes, talks).
2️⃣ Summarize the transcribed text automatically.

All without relying on cloud APIs — everything runs on your local machine using your GPU (currently RTX 4060, planning upgrade to RTX 5070 Ti).

💬 Motivation
Privacy: no audio or text data leaves your system.

Independence: no API fees, no reliance on internet connectivity.

Future-proof: designed to take advantage of future GPU upgrades.

🧰 Architecture
🔊 Audio transcription
Using OpenAI Whisper (local model).

Supports chunking of large audio files to handle memory constraints and enable longer lectures.

🗂️ Audio processing
Preprocessing with pydub or ffmpeg to split and convert audio.

Chunks stored locally for easier debugging and reprocessing.

📝 Text summarization
Using a local LLM (e.g., LLaMA 2, Mistral, Phi, or similar) loaded via:

transformers + bitsandbytes (for 4-bit/8-bit GPU acceleration).

or llama-cpp-python with GGUF models (more lightweight, simpler).

⚙️ Technical environment
Python 3.10 (preferred for compatibility).

Virtual environment (venv) inside the project folder.

Dependencies: Whisper, pydub, ffmpeg-python, transformers, bitsandbytes, llama-cpp-python, torch.

FFmpeg system-wide install for audio manipulation.

🖥️ Hardware considerations
Current GPU (RTX 4060): handles Whisper "base" or "medium" and 7B LLMs (quantized).

Future GPU (RTX 5070 Ti): allows larger Whisper "large" models and 13B–34B LLMs, faster inference.

CPU: Ryzen 5 7600x

RAM: 32Gb DDR5 6000Mhz

🟢 Goals and future extensions
Automate end-to-end pipeline: input audio → output summarized document.

Add optional sentence-level timestamps or highlight keywords.

Enable batch processing of multiple lectures at once.

Possibly add GUI or CLI options for chunk size, model choice, output formats.

💬 Bottom line
A fully local, self-contained AI utility that empowers you to transcribe and digest spoken content into summaries automatically — fast, private, and GPU-accelerated, ready to scale with your future hardware upgrades.
